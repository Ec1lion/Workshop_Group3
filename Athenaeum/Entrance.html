            When thinking of the concept of our website we were thinking about our fellow students and how we should help them, that’s when we came  up with Athenaeum

            Athenaeum is a website that serves as an online library of Self Learning Modules from Grades 7 - 10. In Athenaeum, modules are organized into Subject, Grade Level, and Quarter so learners can easily find the right module. The best part of Athenaeum? It’s online so that in the chance that a learner’s textbook is in poor condition they can simply go to Athenaeum. So, what are you waiting for? <h2>
